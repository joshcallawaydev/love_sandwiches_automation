# love_sandwiches_automation

This is a command line application to demonstrate my understanding of Python and automation.

The application communicates with Google drive and sheets via the google APIs, and is used by inputting data into the command line which will then update google sheets and predict stock requirements for the following day.

With more time i would further develop this application, starting with a user interface to remove the need to use the command line, making the application more user friendly.

## UX

With this being a command line application, there was no requirements for UX design.
